# Augmented-spritebatch
helper class for love2d engine to make spritebatches more flexible

Basically has same functionality like vanilla spritebatch, except it aims to help attachAttribute usage. 
Also can track its own mesh so user doesn't have to create separate one to modify sprites in his project, which is nice.

More in example and in code comments.
